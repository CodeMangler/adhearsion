Story: Parsing AMI

	As an Asterisk user
	I want to parse the AMI protocol
	So that I can control Asterisk
	
	Scenario: Parsing only the initial AMI version header
	
		Given a new parser
		And a version header for AMI 1.0
		
		When I parse the protocol
		
		Then the protocol have parsed without syntax errors
		And the version should be set to 1.0
		
	Scenario: Parsing the initial AMI header and a login attempt
	
		Given a new parser
		And a version header for AMI 1.0
		And a normal login attempt with events
		
		Then the protocol have parsed without syntax errors
