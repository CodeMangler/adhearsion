This is LITERALLY a problem with AMI:

>> Action: Queues
>> ActionID: 12378
>> 
<< No queues.



Response: Follows
Privilege: Command
ActionID: 123123
Host                            Username       Refresh State                Reg.Time                 
--END COMMAND--



When doing a login, if you give it an ActionID, it won't send it back if there's an error.
