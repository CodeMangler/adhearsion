This is LITERALLY a problem with AMI:

»Action: Queues
»ActionID: 12378
» 
« No queues.



Response: Follows
Privilege: Command
ActionID: 123123
Host                            Username       Refresh State                Reg.Time                 
--END COMMAND--



When doing a login, if you give it an ActionID, it won't send it back if there's an error.



WOW: immediate responses can have up to four \r\n's. This is an example immediate response:

"markq        has 0 calls (max unlimited) in 'ringall' strategy (0s holdtime), W:0, C:0, A:0, SL:0.0% within 0s\r\n   No Members\r\n   No Callers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"


Below is an example of "causal events":

Action: QueueStatus

Response: Success
Message: Queue status will follow

Event: QueueParams
Queue: markq
Max: 0
Calls: 0
Holdtime: 0
Completed: 0
Abandoned: 0
ServiceLevel: 0
ServicelevelPerf: 0.0
Weight: 0

Event: QueueStatusComplete
