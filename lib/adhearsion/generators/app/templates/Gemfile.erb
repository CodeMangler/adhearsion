# Adhearsion depends on the Punchblock library, but here you can specify the major version your application depends on.
# Exercise care when updating the major version, since you might encounter API compatability in parts of your Adhearsion application that rely on the Punchblock API.
# On occasion, an update of Adhearsion might necessitate an update to Punchblock. You will have to manually allow that here, and take care in the upgrade.
