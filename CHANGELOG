Notes from before 0.8.0:
 - Adding a deprecation warning about Fixnum#digit and Fixnum#digits
 - Removed the AMI class and replaced it with the ManagerInterface class.
 - The old AMI high-level instance methods are available in the new ManagerInterface class, but a deprecation warning will be logged each time they're used. When the SuperManager class is implemented, they'll be removed entirely.
