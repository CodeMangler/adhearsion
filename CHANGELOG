0.8.3
 - The "uniqueid" call channel variable available in dialplan.rb is now *always* a String
 - Renamed interruptable_play to interruptible_play and made interruptible_play() public instead of protected.
 - Fixed an Asterisk Manager Interface parsing issue in which colons sometimes got stuck into the key name.

0.8.2
 - When a call hangs up, Adhearsion will no longer show random exceptions (that were okay) and instead allows the user to rescue a Hangup exception.
 - ManagerInterfaceResponse now include()s DRbUndumped, allowing send_action() to be called directly over DRb.
 - Fixes an inconsequential bug when CTL-C'ing Adhearsion.

0.8.1
 - The sandbox component now comes 
 - Minor bug fixes

0.8.0 rev 2
 - Added a few non-critical files to the .gemspec. They were ignored

Notes from before 0.8.0:
 - (NOTE: This is obviously not a comprehensive list of pre-0.8.0 work. 0.8.0 was a complete rewrite of the previous version)
 - Adding a deprecation warning about Fixnum#digit and Fixnum#digits
 - Removed the AMI class and replaced it with the ManagerInterface class.
 - The old AMI high-level instance methods are available in the new ManagerInterface class, but a deprecation warning will be logged each time they're used. When the SuperManager class is implemented, they'll be removed entirely.
 - Moved Theatre into Adhearsion's lib folder.
